I've been teasing this on my socials over the past couple of weeks.
I have accepted an offer at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which means that my wife and I are moving from Kansas City to Seattle!
My last day at Cerner will be Friday, March 20th, 2020, and I will start as a Software Engineer at ngrok on April 6th, 2020.
I'm so stoked, y'all! üôå

## A Little Reflection

It's bittersweet, to say the least.
Excluding college, I have lived in Kansas City all of my life.
Hell, I remember going to Bannister Mall and visiting the Toys 'R Us as a wee tike.
Those places exist no more; they are just memories that Cerner's Innovations campus now stands on.

If you know me personally, you know that I live and breathe Kansas City.
The Plaza lighting ceremony is nothing short of magical üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
I established a relationship with Jesus here.
My wife and I were married here.
We are die-hard First Fridays and Weekend Vintage Revival goers (‚ù§Ô∏è _Bella Patina_).
I proposed to her under the 12th street bridge in the West Bottoms üíç.
Both of our families are rooted here.
I've met so many kind and considerate, beautiful people here.
I cried when Sporting won the MLS Cup in 2013, when the Royals won the World Series in 2015, and most recently when the Chiefs were crowned Super Bowl LIV champions.
My blood is probably at least thirty-percent Jack Stack beans and the rest an amalgamation of BBQ sauce and Thou Mayest, Blip, and Messenger coffees.
Without a doubt, I will miss all of these _lo**KC**al_ gems.
At the same time, I am thrilled about what's to come.
Neither my wife nor I have been to the Pacific Northwest before.
We've been assured that it's gorgeous.
And we cannot wait to embark on this adventure together!

## Regarding the Local Behemoth

My work life at Cerner has been nothing short of a blessing.
I have been afforded so many opportunities to grow professionally.
As I've said before, my background was not in web development.
Right from the get-go, I was placed on one of the best teams in the HealtheIntent organization.
I learned JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and so many other technical skills throughout my tenure.
It has been a huge stepping stone for my career.

It's sad to say goodbye to my current team, and I will miss them immensely.
My manager is incredible, and my teammates are such a joy to work with (even the ones that can be... challenging. You know who you are üòÇ).
I wish everyone the best going forward and will miss the _Fika_.
