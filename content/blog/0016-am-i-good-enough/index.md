## How do you handle rejection?

What do you do when something you've been working for and betting on ends in failure?
How do you react to disappointment and a discouraging result?

I was on the receiving end of one of these situations today.
This was something I had been preparing for and practicing over the past month and a half.
This was an assessment that I did not pass.
Allow me to journal for a moment and pour out my feelings.

## I mixed emotions right now

To be honest, each of these competing emotions is fighting for the spotlight.
At any given second, one wins out.

On the one hand, I want to sulk.
I want to be sad and recognize my sadness.
I want to be heard and understood by how I feel.
I want to meditate on why I was not good enough.
I feel like an imposter.
_Am I good enough?_
Are **_they_** right?

On the other, I am finding that fire burns within me.
I know that I am good enough to pursue my passions.
I know that I am beautifully and intelligently made with purpose and perfect intent.
There is a time and a place for everything.

## I cannot dwell

I know the path forward, but I need to be patient.
My self-worth is not a function of what has happened.
The process takes time.
I'm going to take the night for introspection, but I cannot help but see this situation as a gift and an opportunity.
I have my faults and my weaknesses, but they will not hold me back.

> But he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
> So then, I will boast most gladly about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may reside in me.
>
> 2 Corinthians 9 (NET)

So yes, I **_am_** good enough.
And I will be back.
