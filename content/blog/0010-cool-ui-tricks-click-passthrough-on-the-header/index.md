I recently updated my primary navigation.
You know, this thing:

![Primary Navigation](./primary-navigation.png)

Underneath the primary navigation is a [stripe](https://www.stripe.com) inspired header.
Inside the clipped header is a `<canvas>` element that renders a starry background that you can interact with through hover and clicking.
Hovering produces a _"brightening"_ effect on stars adjacent to the mouse, like so:

![Navigation mouse hover animation](./navigation-hover.gif)

And clicking allows you to _"blow up"_ the stars, blasting them in all directions:

## The Problem

The navigation is rather delightful to play with.
Unfortunately, you originally could not click or hover on the region between my name and the navigation links.

Even though there doesn't appear to be anything between my name and the list of links, pointer interactions fail to register!

## Interactive Example Time ‚è∞

Let's play around with some interactable examples!
In each example, you can click and hover on things within the dashed boxes.
I've created a mock navigation header that loosely resembled the primary navigation on my site.
Think of it like if you turned the graphics settings **_way_** down.

For this first example, I want to demonstrate the way my navigation originally worked; or, what happens when the navigation blocks interaction as if there's an invisible wall.

As you click on items, the _"Last clicked"_ element will update to display what you last clicked on.
You can do the following:

- The background is both _clickable_ **and** _hoverable_
- The avatar circle is both _clickable_ **and** _hoverable_
- The navigation region is _clickable_
- You can toggle on/off the visibility of the navigation bounds (note: this does not remove them entirely; they are still rendered, but will just be completely transparent or invisible)

_Isn't it odd that there's a central region where an interactivity dead zone exists?_

<Example caption={`An interactable example displaying our "invisible wall"`}>
<MockNavigation />
</Example>

## What Went Wrong

The above behavior is unsurprising if you're familiar with DOM flow and stacking contexts.
But, to the average person, it provides a **_bad user experience_** because it breaks the [Principal of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).
You would expect the starry background in my primary navigation to be interactable in all of its rendered regions.
It is jarring to experience that _"invisible wall"_.
I want to explain more on why this wall exists, but first, here's the same example from above, but now you can also toggle on/off the _"invisible wall's"_ **_"presence"_**.

<Example caption={`An interactable example with the ability to remove the "invisible wall"`}>
<MockNavigation
    pointerEventPassthroughEnabled
    passthroughInitialValue
  />
</Example>

When the navigation bounds are visible, but we remove the _"invisible wall"_, the background can receive our click!

## How it Works

TLDR: [pointer-events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events)!

There is a CSS property called `pointer-events` which allows you to manipulate if a DOM element receives pointer events (e.g. `click`s, `hover`, etc).
If you set it to `none`, then that element and all of its children will no longer process pointer events!

ü§Ø

Let's look at the simplified DOM of my navigation with minimal styling using [emotion, an incredible css-in-js library](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction):

```jsx
/* top level element sets pointer events to none */
<div css={{ pointerEvents: "none" }}>
  <div css={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", position: "relative" }}>
    {/* The starry background üëá*/}
    <div css={{ position: "absolute" }}>
      <canvas>‚ú®</canvas>
    </div>
    <nav
      css={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "space-between",
        position: "relative"
      }}
    >
      {/* manually enable pointerEvents for all children after here*/}
      <a href="#" css={{ pointerEvents: "auto" }}>
        Cody A. Price
      </a>
      <ul
        css={{
          display: "flex",
          listStyle: "none",
          margin: 0,
          pointerEvents: "auto"
        }}
      >
        <a href="#">Blog</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
</div>
```

Notice that we turn off all `pointer-events` on the parent element and then selectively turn `pointer-events` back on for **_specific children_**.

## You Got Your Chocolate in my Peanut Butter üòî

It seems kind of odd to me that such behavior is delegated to CSS instead of Javascript.
I mean, it's not like [`cursor: pointer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) where it's a **_purely "presentational"_** effect.
With Javascript, (examples following being of the React flavor) you enhance DOM elements by adding `event listeners` which trigger on interactions providing the desired functionality.
By setting `pointer-events: none;` on a DOM element, you are turning off all cursor interactions for **_and its children!_**
This is crazy to me! üòú
Sounds an awful lot like a Javascript concern, namely something like:

```js
function DestroyAllClicks() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  function increment() {
    setCount(c => c + 1)
  }

  function preventAllClicks(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    event.stopPropagation()
  }

  return (
    <div onClickCapture={preventAllClicks}>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        Increment count
      </button>
      <p>Count = {count}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Example caption="Interactive example: prevent all click handlers from processing in children using Javascript">
  <DestroyAllClicks />
</Example>

It pushes me further and further from the _misguided_ belief that your ~~peanut butter shouldn't mix with my chocolate~~ UI concerns should be separated.
The lines are so blurred now.
Javascript isn't just for adding _"functionality"_, it's also for rendering and animations.
CSS isn't just for presentational styling, it's also for interactivity/functionality.
And with web components, well, the lines continue to be blurred!

## Conclusion

I strive for great UX, but it's a constant battle.
This site, as of writing this article, still has a long way to go, but **_iterators gonna iterate_**.
It's all too easy to get caught up in the technical details when developing something.

- What should `${it}` do?
- What are the requirements?
- Do you provide a good user experience?

Initially, I thought I hit the mark for my navigation bar (technically I still haven't because my mobile nav is atrocious üò≤ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ).
But, only by taking a step back and looking at the full context of where the navigation was rendered and how it should interact with its adjacent elements (in the DOM order or stacking order) was I able to fully address my requirements and provide a good user experience.
And I got to learn about and use a cool, but odd CSS property along the way!
