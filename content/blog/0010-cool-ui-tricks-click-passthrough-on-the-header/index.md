I recently updated my primary navigation.
You know, this thing:

![Primary Navigation](./primary-navigation.png)

Underneath the primary navigation is a [stripe](https://www.stripe.com) inspired header.
Inside the clipped header is a `<canvas>` element that renders a starry background that you can interact with through hover and clicking.
Hovering produces a _"brightening"_ effect on stars adjacent to the mouse, like so:

And clicking allows you to _"blow up"_ the stars, blasting them in all directions:

## The Problem

The navigation is rather delightful to play with.
Unfortunately, you originally could not click or hover on the region between my name and the navigation links.

Even though there doesn't appear to be anything between my name and the list of links, pointer interactions fail to register!

## Interactive Example Time ‚è∞

Let's play around with some interactable examples!
In each example, you can click and hover on things within the dashed boxes.
I've created a mock navigation header that loosely resembled the primary navigation on my site.
Think of it like if you turned the graphics settings **_way_** down.

For this first example, I want to demonstrate the way my navigation originally worked; or, what happens when the navigation blocks interaction as if there's an invisible wall.

As you click on items, the _"Last clicked"_ element will update to display what you last clicked on.
You can do the following:

- The background is both _clickable_ **and** _hoverable_
- The avatar circle is both _clickable_ **and** _hoverable_
- The navigation region is _clickable_
- You can toggle on/off the visibility of the navigation bounds (note: this does not remove them entirely; they are still rendered, but will just be completely transparent or invisible)

_Isn't it odd that there's a central region where an interactivity dead zone exists?_

<Example />

## What Went Wrong

The above behavior is unsurprising if you're familiar with DOM flow and stacking contexts.
But, to the average person, it provides a **_bad user experience_** because it breaks the [Principal of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).
You would expect the starry background in my primary navigation to be interactable in all of its rendered regions.
It is jarring to experience that _"invisible wall"_.
I want to explain more on why this wall exists, but first, here's the same example from above, but now you can also toggle on/off the _"invisible wall's"_ **_"presence"_**.

<Example
  pointerEventPassthroughEnabled
  passthroughInitialValue
/>
<br />

When the navigation bounds are visible, but we remove the _"invisible wall"_, the background can receive our click!

## How it Works

TLDR: [pointer-events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events)!

There is a CSS property called `pointer-events` which allows you to manipulate if a DOM element receives pointer events (e.g. `click`s, `hover`, etc).
