Kiley and I have some BIG news üì∞ that we cannot hold in any longer.
We are pregnant! ‚ù§Ô∏è

We have been sitting on this, anxious to share since the beginning of April!
In fact, we found out **_TWO DAYS_** before we set out on our adventurous move to Seattle.
We weren't planning or expecting a baby, but we feel so incredibly blessed that a healthy baby is growing and cannot wait to meet them!

Kiley's due date is _December 10th_.
We find out the gender when we fly back to Kansas City for a week in mid-August.
Kiley wants a girl, but my money is on a boy! `#housedivided` üò§
