title: "Bad DX: On Developer Experience, or Professional Complaints for ${this.lang}"
---

Being a full-time software engineer basically means I'm a paid professional complainer.
Well, sort of.
At the very least, I'm highly opinionated on language theory, APIs, frameworks, tooling, and overall _developer experience_.
In this series, I pretend to be an expert on things that I'm not in order to explain my displeasure or distaste of them.
